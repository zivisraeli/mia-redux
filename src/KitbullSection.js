	      <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pixar has a pretty impressive track record for making audiences cry, but it has truly outdone itself by achieving full-scale weeps in a matter of mere minutes with the animation studio's new short film, Kitbull. The film - a production of Pixar's new SparkShorts program - tells a tearjerking story of an "unlikely connection that sparks between two creatures" under dire circumstances. A fiercely independent stray kitten happens upon an abused Pitbull, and as director Rosana Sullivan said, "together, they experience friendship for the first time."
	        <br/><br/>
	        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's simple and sweet, but - through a few startling scenes - it also makes a powerful statement about the treatment of animals, and it might even open up more meaningful conversations about the reputation of Pitbulls being an aggressive and dangerous breed.
	        <br/><br/>
	        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of this nine-minute video, you'll certainly find yourself wiping away tears, and regardless of whether you consider yourself a dog person or a cat person, it will reaffirm your love of all animals and make you hug your own pets a bit tighter tonight.
